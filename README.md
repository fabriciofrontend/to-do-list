# to-do-list

I am very excited to share my second personal project as a student at CESAE. 🚀

It is a to-do list where it's possible to add tasks during the day. 📝 

Besides adding tasks, it's possible to confirm them as done or otherwise not done.

It is a simple project, but it requires some knowledge of the logic of programming that JavaScript performs. 😉

In summary, there are three functions for three different situations: (1 to add the user's task, 2 to remove, in case the user wants to remove some previously added, and 3 to complete the user's task when completing the task by pressing the done button.

Finally, a listening event stops when the user loads a new task to the list. 

The reason I did this project is to be able to put into practice some situations that I learned about the JS language at CESAE. 👨🏻‍💻

Another reason, but not less important, is that in addition to HTML as a structuring basis, I used some CSS elements to have a relaxed look.

I hope you enjoyed it! ✌️
